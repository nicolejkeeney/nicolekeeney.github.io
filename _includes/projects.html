			<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dust Transport Modelling</strong>
			- I've been collaborating with a team at UCLA and Cal State East Bay to calibrate a high resolution wind erosion model using remote sensing data. 
			This project is part of an initiative at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health to study the environmental dynamics of Valley Fever (<i>coccidioidomycosis</i>), 
			a fungal infection thought to be transmitted by airborne dust.

			<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cloud-Optimized Polar Climate Model Validation</strong>
			- I've been developing cloud-optimized code for validating polar climate models using satellite data. 
			This project focuses on streamlining the validation pipeline and developing easy-to-use methods for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://nicolekeeney.com/icesat2-book">ICESat-2 Jupyter Book</a></strong>
			- I built an interactive Jupyter Book that highlights python code for evaluating winter sea ice growth in the Arctic over several years.
			This project uses monthly gridded sea ice thickness data from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite mission, along with related sea ice and atmospheric datasets.

    <h5>
			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/nicolejkeeney/fluxnet_ESI">Parameterizing a Drought Index</a></strong>
			- I conducted original research for an undergraduate honors thesis where I evaluated a parameterization of an evapotranspiration-based drought index. 
			This work was supervised by Prof. Dennis Baldocchi and relied on <i>in-situ</i> flux measurements from eddy covariance towers and a planetary boundary layer model.
